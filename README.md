Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding my entire life (_Really, I started when I was 6 years old_) and always shared what I created with the community. Speaking at conferences, writing books, teaching at universities, running a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MatiasIacono) and, of course, with code... specially code... specially wanting to help fellow developers that could benefit from it.

I love to invest my time behind the keyboard creating tools and frameworks that would help developers to improve their work, to make their lives a little bit easier, or even help to newcomers to gain passion and experience for what we do.

Some of my projects:

- [SACP](https://github.com/MatiasIac/SACP) A semantic communication protocol for orchestrating structured, interoperable, and extensible multi-agent LLM systems.
- [jsGFwk](https://github.com/MatiasIac/jsGFwk) A very light-weight video game framework created in a coding rush (_40 hours for the core_) that evolved to a very mature state. I have created so many videogames with this framework that I am very proud of.
- [MockAPI](https://github.com/MatiasIac/mockapi) A rapid API mocking for testing and development which I am evolving from time to time. Honestly, I couldn't do some of my work without it. It is free, it is very easy to use and serve its purpose.
- [FluentSharp](https://github.com/MatiasIac/fluentsharp) A set of tools that extends key areas of C#. In particular, areas that requires unnecessary extra classes. FluentSharp make your coding experience easier. .Net 6 and new versions of C# have evolved to follow this same approach, so, good tool anyways.ðŸ˜„
