# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hi, Iâ€™m MatÃ­as â€” Iâ€™ve been coding since I was 6 years old (yes, really), and Iâ€™ve never stopped.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve shared my work with the developer community in many ways: speaking at conferences, writing books, teaching at universities, running a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MatiasIacono), and â€” above all â€” writing code. I build tools, frameworks, and libraries to make developers' lives easier and to help newcomers fall in love with software development.

Whether you're here to explore, contribute, or just get inspired, welcome!

## ðŸš€ Projects I'm Proud Of

Here are a few highlights from my personal toolbox:

### ðŸ”· [SACP](https://github.com/MatiasIac/SACP)
A **semantic communication protocol** for orchestrating structured, interoperable, and extensible multi-agent LLM systems. Built to make AI agents work together â€” clearly, efficiently, and scalably.

### ðŸŽ® [jsGFwk](https://github.com/MatiasIac/jsGFwk)
A **lightweight HTML5/JavaScript video game framework**, born in a 40-hour coding burst and matured over many years. Iâ€™ve built countless games with it, and it continues to evolve. Great for learning or rapid prototyping.

### ðŸ§ª [MockAPI](https://github.com/MatiasIac/mockapi)
A **Node.js-based API mocker** designed for rapid development and testing â€” especially useful when your frontend or backend is waiting on an API still under construction. Fast, simple, and essential in my daily workflow.

### ðŸ’¡ [FluentSharp](https://github.com/MatiasIac/fluentsharp)
A **fluent-style extension library for C#**, created to simplify repetitive code patterns and reduce boilerplate. Some ideas from this project have made it into modern .NET â€” but itâ€™s still a helpful tool for cleaner, more expressive code.
